About the app-

This app is about the “stories” that define people’s lives and value system, often shared over a cup of coffee.
It is for anyone who has a treasured memory from their past be it; moms and daughters, friends, casual acquaintances

It also allows user to locate ad find any near by Cafe and read some facts about Coffee in the CoffeePedia section.
